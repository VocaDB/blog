# New feature: event notifications

There’s a new feature on VocaDB, or more specifically, a combination of multiple existing features: event notifications for followed artists.

Let’s say you’re following [Clean Tears](http://vocadb.net/Ar/20).

And a new event is added where he’s participating.

You get a notification!

So maybe you’ll get a chance to see him performing.

Obviously, events are tied to a specific location, and most of the stuff happens in Japan. That’s why, in the future, we will add more geographical information to events, so you could, for example, opt out from notifications when the event is nowhere near you.
