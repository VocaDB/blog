Not strictly VocaDB-related, but we’re announcing the open beta testing for [TouhouDB](https://touhoudb.com/), another related website based on the familiar [VocaDB platform](http://blog.vocadb.net/vocadb-as-a-platform/).

## What is it for?

TouhouDB is intended to be a music discography database similar to VocaDB, but containing Touhou-related music instead of Vocaloid. Both original songs and arrangements are intended to be listed, including albums and PVs from streaming sites such as YouTube and NicoNicoDouga. Conventions are mostly the same as VocaDB.

## Why are we doing this?

Because VocaDB has proven to be a robust and adaptable platform. There are many similarities between the Vocaloid and Touhou music scenes, and thus significant synergy. Many artists are working in both scenes, and both are primarily based on doujin publication model focused in Japan. The feature set required by the website is mostly the same, so the same platform can be adapted with little effort.

## What is open beta?

The structure of the database is still being worked on, meaning the list of song and album types may change based on feedback. Feel free to register and start editing if you’re interested. The same guidelines from VocaDB apply for the most part.

If you have questions or wish to discuss the website, there’s [a Discord server for TouhouDB](https://discord.gg/GscZYEE). Feel free to post comments here as well, or in the discussion area.
