# Benefits of a VocaDB account

I talked to many people who are using VocaDB without an account and unsure what’s the benefit of having an account. Editing the database is not the only feature accessible with an account. In addition to editing, with a VocaDB account you can:

- Keep track of albums you own and albums you want to buy.
- Subscribe to new releases by your favorite artists (producers or Vocaloids).
- Subscribe to new releases with your favorite genres.
- Keep track of your favorite songs (YouTube, NicoNico, SoundCloud, etc. on one site).
- Create custom song lists.
- Keep track of events (such as concerts) you’ve been to.
