Another year has passed again and it’s the time of our annual statistical report.

The year 2017 was a little more special with the 10th anniversary of the most recognized vocaloid – Hatsune Miku. We got to see a vast amount of the songs (and albums) that were published in the celebration of the two-digit milestone. The [event page on VocaDB](http://vocadb.net/E/1513/mikus-birthday-2017) lists a total of 229 songs and 40 albums released around the date of Miku’s birthday.

According to the [first work -tag](http://vocadb.net/T/158/first-work), there were over 400 artists new to the vocaloid scene the past year. By comparison, the total number of active vocaloid music producers was around 4700.
